## Game Features

List and describe the key features of your game. This could include:

Certainly! Based on the provided code, here's an overview of the basic rules and mechanics of the game:

1. **Character and Car Creation:**
   - At the start of the game, the player creates a character and a car with specified attributes such as health, dexterity, luck, armor, and firepower.

2. **Randomized Events:**
   - The game includes various events that involve random outcomes. These events are determined by rolling a six-sided die (D6) or using variations of it (e.g., D6-12-36).

3. **Inventory Management:**
   - Players can manage their inventory, which includes items such as weapons and other items. The `modify_inventory` function allows for adding, removing, or resetting quantities of items in the player's inventory.

4. **Combat Systems:**
   - The game features different combat systems, including close combat, firearms combat, and car combat.
   - Close Combat: Players engage in battles with enemies. The outcome is determined by comparing attack powers based on dexterity and weapon damage.
   - Firearms Combat: Similar to close combat but incorporates the use of ranged weapons. Players choose a ranged weapon from their inventory to engage enemies.
   - Car Combat: Players battle enemies using cars, considering car firepower, armor, and the option to use special items like rockets.

5. **Test of Luck and Dexterity:**
   - There are events that test the player's luck or dexterity. The player's luck or dexterity score is compared to a random score, and the outcome affects the direction of the story.

6. **Story Progression:**
   - The game is driven by a series of stories, and the player's choices in events determine the progression of the story.
   - Some story options may include property modifications, such as altering the player's health, dexterity, luck, car firepower, or car armor.

7. **Checking Inventory and Stats:**
   - Players can check their current inventory and stats at any time during the game.
   - The inventory includes information about weapons, items, and other relevant game elements.

8. **Game Over and Victory:**
   - The game can end in either victory or defeat. A "game over" scenario occurs if the player's car armor reaches zero. The "WIN" scenario indicates the player has successfully completed the game.

9. **Contributions:**
   - The README suggests that others can contribute to the project. Contributions may involve bug reporting, feature requests, or code contributions following specific guidelines.

Remember that the provided explanation is based on the code's structure, and specific details may depend on the actual content of the stories, enemies, and events defined in your game.
